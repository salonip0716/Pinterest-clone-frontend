Java is a complied + interpreted language.
It is platform independent becoz of the JVM.
 
your code 
   |  #compile (javac)
bytecode (.class)
    |  JVM
Runs on any OS       

CORE java 
  language fundamentals
  OOP , memory , collections,exceptions

ADVANCED java 
   web stuff (Servelts, JSP,JDBC) 

 SPRING /Spring boot
    frameworks built on the tops of core java


JVM - java virtual machine
    it runs bytecode
JRE- java runtime environment 
    JVM + libraries (to run java apps) 
JDK - Java development kit 
  JRE + tools (to write java apps)

INstall and setup

  VS CODE

 FIrst PROGRAM 
   class HElloworld {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        System.out.println("HELLO WORLD!");
    }
   }                  

    class - everything in java lives inside a class 
    main - JVM starts exceution here
    public static - JVM can call it without creating object.
    String args[]- command-line inputs

how java thinks :
    strict syntax
    strong typing 
    no shortcuts
    errors are teachers, not enemies 


variables:
 a named memory location that stores a value of a fixed type.
